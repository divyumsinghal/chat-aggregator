Address it immediately to unblock the team.\n2.  **Bring engineering headcount projections to the Q4 budget review meeting**\n    *   **Context:** The meeting is tomorrow (Monday) at 2 pm.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Prepare these projections first thing Monday morning to ensure you're ready for the meeting.\n\n---\n\n#### **Priority 1: High Priority (Do Monday/Early This Week)**\nThese items have imminent deadlines, are daily duties, or are important tasks that need to be started or completed early in the week.\n\n3.  **Post your status on the integration work for Project Alpha**\n    *   **Context:** Reminder for standup, likely expected for Monday morning.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Provide your update as part of your regular Monday morning routine.\n4.  **Attend the All-hands meeting on Monday at 10 am**\n    *   **Context:** Mandatory attendance, moved to Monday 10 am.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Block this time on your calendar and ensure your attendance.\n5.  **Complete your direct reports' performance reviews in Workday**\n    *   **Context:** Due by December 15th.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Start scheduling time this week to work on these reviews to meet the deadline comfortably.\n6.  **Update the project roadmap**\n    *   **Context:** Due by Friday to reflect the API migration to January 15th.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Plan to get this done mid-week, allowing time for any necessary coordination.\n\n---\n\n#### **Priority 2: Medium Priority (Schedule This Week)**\nThese items are important but do not have an immediate blocking impact or an imminent deadline that requires immediate attention today or Monday morning.\n\n7.  **Join the customer feedback session on Thursday at 3 pm**\n    *   **Context:** Scheduled for Thursday at 3 pm.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Add this to your calendar and plan to attend to represent engineering.\n8.  **Update your local environments to PostgreSQL 16**\n    *   **Context:** Standardization for \"all new services.\"\n    *   **Recommendation:** While important for future development, it doesn't appear to be blocking current critical tasks. Schedule this update when you have a less urgent block of time.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Critical Context:**\nBe aware that the CI pipeline is failing on main and the staging environment is down (ETA 2 hours). While not direct action items for you from this list, these are critical system states that may affect your work or require your attention if related to your projects."
